# /r/FortniteBR
A repository containing work that I freely worked on during my tenure as a head mod for /r/FortniteBR and the collective family of developer supported subreddits.

## Warning:
Some of the code maybe buggy, the comments may not be excellent, and there is most likely tons of places that improvement could be made but simply ran out of time on. These files are recent as of December 17th, 2018.

## Contents:
`fortnitebr.css` - A file containing the codebase that makes up the CSS for /r/FortniteBR. All other subreddits (/r/Fortnite, /r/FortniteCreative, /r/FortniteMobile, etc.) are recolored derivatives of this file with slight differences on a subreddit-to-subreddit basis.

`fortnitebr.yaml` - A file containing the YAML that makes up the AutoModerator for /r/FortniteBR. This is heavily modified on /r/Fortnite, mostly the same on /r/FortniteMobile, and slightly modified on /r/FortniteCreative.

[TiltedTowersBot](https://github.com/Snaacky/TiltedTowersBot) - A repostory containing the bot used on /r/FortniteBR to automatically take down posts that haven't been flaired within 30 minutes of being posted. Written in Python 3.x, co-authored by [SirPacker](https://github.com/SirPacker). This is the code that now runs /u/NoSkinBot although there is no relation other than them using our codebase and renaming it.
